<h2><u>Where we Work/ About Us/General/Contacting</u></h2>
<h2>
How do I contact a department or person within your organization?</h2>

For privacy and security reasons, CI does not publish staff addresses. We do not have forwarding information for former CI employees, CI partners or spokespeople, or for members of our Board of Directors or Chairman's Council. To contact a current CI employee by mail, please use the main office address:
2011 Crystal Dr. Suite 500
Arlington VA, 22202<br><h2>
I am a CI member or donor and I would like to report an address change.</h2>

To report your change of address, please write to membership@conservation.org. Be sure to include your name, your current address, and your former address.<br><h2>
There is an environmental problem in my neighborhood/region. What can CI do to help?</h2>

We focus our conservation efforts in areas known as biodiversity hotspots, wilderness areas, and key marine regions – places with the highest levels of species and threats, and places where we know our conservation dollars can save the most species. Learn more about these unique places.<br><h2>
Can CI buy the land that I have available for sale?</h2>

CI supports governments and communities in their efforts to manage important conservation lands for biodiversity, but we do not directly purchase land. Unfortunately, CI cannot contact or recommend any potential buyers for your land.<h2>
I would like to interview someone from CI or have a speaker come to my event or school.</h2>

If you are interested in a specific project, topic, region, or department, we will gladly forward your speaking request to the appropriate CI expert. It is the individual decision of our staff members to accept your request. We do not have the resources to arrange for general speakers from our offices. Contact our office for more information.
