<br><p><h2>
Nothing CI does is possible without the support of our donors and partners.
<br><br>
Together, we're changing the world. We're changing lives. We're ensuring that people and nature continue to thrive, now and for generations to come.</h2></p>
<br><br>
Our approach is simple, yet transformative:
<ul>
<li><h3>We are protecting our natural wealth</h3> 
...the essential places on Earth that provide our food, water and the very air we breathe — by ensuring that the most critical areas remain intact and capable of providing benefits to the communities that need them.
</li><li>
<h3>We are fostering effective governance</h3>
...by working with governments and civil society, we provide tools, counsel and training that enable leaders to make better decisions for the long-term health and economic stability of their people.</li><li>

<h3>We are working with businesses</h3>
...that have big environmental impacts like mining, energy and agricultural companies — to ensure that production does not destroy the ecological health and vitality of nations.</li></ul>
