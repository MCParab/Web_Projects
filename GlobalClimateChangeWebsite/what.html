<p><h1>CI's 6 initiatives</h1>
<h2>Without thriving ecosystems, we cannot guarantee a stable climate, accessible fresh water and sufficient food, limited threats to human health, rich cultural diversity and the innumerable unknown benefits that nature provides. In short, people need nature to thrive.</h2>

CI focuses on these key areas of human needs because they illustrate the deep links between humanity and nature, maximize the impact of CI's experience and expertise, and demonstrate the importance of taking a coordinated local, regional and global approach.
<br><br>
CI seeks to address all of these efforts simultaneously and transform our greatest challenges into the greatest opportunity of our time.<p><br><br>
